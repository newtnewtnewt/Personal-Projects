	<h1> <i> A foreword by Noah Dunn: </i>
		It is not often a tale gets to be told with such emotional
		depth as the one I am prepared to display before you today, but 
		as Stephen King often likes to say <q>It is not the teller, but merely the tale</q>

		<p>
			On a very sunny day in the middle of the woods, a family of three newts 
				were eating breakfast together and laughing the day away. There was <b>Momma Newt</b>, 
				<b>Papa Newt</b> and <b>Baby Newt</b> all together. After breakfast, the family decided to go
				out for a morning walk to enjoy the sunny, but cool weather. Minutes after they had left,
				a young boy named <b>Newtilocks</b>, also on a walk for the day, found himself in front of the Three Newts' Cabin.
				Curious about who was inside, he wandered in the door that was unlocked. After all, this was the Midwest,
				no one locked their doors. </p>

		<p> Newtilocks was never a troublemaker, but he was hungry and tired from a long day walking. When he came to the table in the dining room, he found 3 breakfast burritos partially
			eaten. At first he tried Papa Newt's burrito. <q> This one has too much ketchup in it </q> he exclaimed! Next he tried Momma Newt's burrito. <q> I cannot believe
				the lack of salt in these eggs, this is practically inedible </q> Newtilocks was discouraged but tried the final burrito, Baby Newt's. <q> Finally a breakfast 
				burrito worth eating </q> Newtilocks then ran over to the couch and went to talk a nap, because who doesn't like couch naps? Unfortunate for Newtilock's luck, the 
			three newts had returned home. Newtilocks sprung awoke from the couch, and was confronted by all three newts, looking very angry."

			Newtilocks had a brief recollection of a story like this long ago, but he couldn't remember all the details quite right.
			The newts were all very angry looking, but after he explained how tired and hungry he had been with his MyFitnessPro Tracker
			and FitBit logs for the day, the Newt family saw exactly where he had been coming from. They welcomed him into the house for the remainder 
			of the nice, cool, sunny day and enjoyed the company of each other for many years to come. The ending, much like any good kid's story should end,
			was indeed happily ever after. THE END.</p>
